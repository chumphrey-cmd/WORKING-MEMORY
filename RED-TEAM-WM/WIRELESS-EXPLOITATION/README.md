# Wireless Enumeration Reference Guide

This document serves as a comprehensive reference guide for various aspects of wireless enumeration. It compiles notes and commands related to discovering, analyzing, and potentially assessing the security of wireless networks and related technologies.

**Purpose:**

This guide is intended for personal use and as a quick reference when encountering wireless enumeration tasks. It aims to provide a consolidated resource covering a range of tools and techniques.

* **[Wireless-Quick-Start](./Wireless-Quick-Start.md)**: Extracts essential commands and concepts from the more in-depth "**Wireless-WM.md**". This is designed for quick lookups and commonly used procedures.

* **[Wireless-WM](./Wireless-WM.md)**: Contains detailed theory, concepts, and other information that isn't as easy to navigate quickly. It serves as the general repository and documentation for Wireless Enumeration information.

**Contents:**

The guide covers the following key areas:

* **Basic Connectivity:** Initial steps for configuring and connecting to wireless networks.
* **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions during wireless network interaction.
* **Network Scanning:** Techniques and tools like `netdiscover`, `fping`, and `nmap` for identifying devices on a network.
* **Service Enumeration:** Using `nmap` to identify open ports and services running on target devices.
* **Forensic Investigation:** Initial notes related to forensic analysis.
* **Wireless Monitoring and Capture:** Utilizing tools like `airmon-ng` and `airodump-ng` to set up monitor mode and capture wireless traffic.
* **Software Defined Radio (SDR):** Introduction to using HackRF for monitoring and collecting radio signals.
* **War Driving and Network Detection:** Using Kismet for passive network discovery and GPS integration.
* **Packet Analysis:** Employing Wireshark and TShark for in-depth analysis of captured network traffic, including filtering and configuration.
* **Bluetooth Enumeration:** Utilizing Blue Hydra and Blue Sonar for discovering and collecting information about Bluetooth devices.
* **Packet Capture Manipulation:** Using `mergecap`, `editcap`, and `airdecap-ng` for merging, editing, and decrypting packet capture files.
* **MAC Address Spoofing:** Techniques for changing the MAC address of network interfaces.
* **Password Cracking:** Methods and tools like Aircrack-ng, Hashcat, Crunch, and Hydra for attempting to crack passwords for wireless networks and other services.
* **Further Enumeration:** Additional `nmap` commands and techniques for discovering and analyzing network services.
* **Common Services:** Specific commands and approaches for enumerating FTP, HTTP/S, and SMB services.
* **Physical Penetration:** Steps for gaining access to UNIX/Debian systems through physical manipulation of the boot process.
* **Android Apps:** Recommended Android applications for wireless analysis.
