2. **Eliminating Distractions**
3. **Consistent Studying Across the Week**: 3-4 hours **daily**.
4. **Isolating During Studying**: study alone for the retention of information.
5. **Learn from multiple sources**: YouTube, Lecture, Verbalizing with Reasoning Models
6. **Make an Effort to Teach Others**: Watch one, do one, teach one (**rubber ducky**)
7. **Orient the Studying with Higher Order Goals**: ground the reason for study and discipline across time. Belief that what your are doing is essential!

## Pre, During, Post Learning

**Pre**
* Review lecture notes and begin initial outline on the material that will be instructed on for familiarity.

**During**
* Fill the Gaps of the material that you've outlined.
* Take small breaks to retain and rehearse the material that you're learning.

**Post**
* **IMMEDIATELY** following the lecture mental step through what you've learned and jot down difficult concepts.

* Initiate Self Testing Protocol:
    * Use **Anki** for route memorization of terms or techniques.
    * Use **Reasoning Model** to:
        * Develop open-ended, short/long answer, minimal prompt mini-tests over material (e.g., coding example, concepts, etc.)
        * Develop high-quality MC questions that include "trip" Qs forcing you to thinking through the answer rather than familiarity.
    * Teach others the concepts that you've learned to codify the material.
    * Repeat.
