# [Protocol for Studying and Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddq8JIMhz7c)

> [!NOTE]
> In general, learning is the mechanism and system that is used to **offset** forgeting... it's a skill and technique that requires focus and deliberate practice!

## Periodic Testing

* Incremental testing and quizzing on the material that your reviewing.
    * **THINK**: Anki and the learning algo that is used to offset forgetting in general. 

* Two-step process (Neuro-plasticity)
    * Active Engagment - being focused and attending to the information at hand, which are supported by sleep and 
        * Sleep: essential to have the highest ROI when it comes time to learn.
        * Adding an **emphasis**, **urgency**, or **significance** to the content that you are learning (e.g., ensuring that I'm regularly completing `boot.dev` lessons because the concepts are important and align with a higher order goal)
        * Mindfulness Meditation: spending ~10 mins of deliberately bring your attention back to the task at hands to cue 

    * Deep and High Quality Sleep - Rapid Eye Movment (REM) Sleep is essential after you learn something new or difficult.
        * Non-sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): ~10-20 mins used to enhance neuro-plasticity to solidify the learning that you're doing IF you had a bad nights sleep.


## [Highly Effective Study Habits of Successful Students](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8197661/pdf/amep-12-627.pdf)

1. **Timeblocking (Scheduling)**: setting aside periods of time for studying.
    * Ensure that you keep the timeblocking sessions at particular times...
2. **Eliminating Distractions**
3. **Goal Setting**: used to determine the most important activities
4. **Consistent Studying Across the Week**: 3-4 hours of studying and reviewing **daily** at least 5 days per week
5. **Isolating During Studying**: study alone for the retention of information.
6. **Learn from multiple sources**
7. **Make an Effort to Teach Others**: Once you leave the isolation of studying on your own, you then teach others about the material that you've studied to **test** yourself.
    * Watch one, do one, teach one
8. **Orient the Studying with Higher Order Goals**: ground the reason for study and discipline across time. Belief that what your are doing is essential!

## Studying & Aspiration Goals; Challenging Material

* Studying that is the most challenging is often the most effective. 
* Effort is the cornerstone of learning... if the material is difficult to retain, often times that will be the material that you remeber. 

## TOOL ⚙️ - Self-Testing as a Learning Tool

* Using testing as a way to review and test yourself for long-term memory. 
* Thinking about the material that your reviewing and quizzing yourself on concepts related to the material, summarizing that information, using voice-based LLMs to quiz yourself, etc.

### Self Studying + Repeated Testing

* Studies have shown that greater performance outcomes long-term are seen with `Self Study` followed by `Reapeated Testing`.
    * The more test that you take, the greater the **neural encoding** of the material. 

    * **WHY DOES THIS WORK??**
        * This allows you to quickly identify your limits and the material that you don't know.
        * E.g., Preparation for GCFA, conceptualizing the IR cycle from Network Intrusion to Memory Forensics.

> [!WARNING]
> Repeated exposure to only reading the material falsely increases your confidence AND leads to poorer performance!

## New Material & Self-Test Timing

* **Test yourself very soon after being exposed to material to optimize performance and retention on exams.**
* This offsets the natural deterioriation of what you've learned, it codifies the content that you've retained.

* **Potential Self-Testing Protocol**:
    * Takes notes regarding the material > Refine those notes to fill any gaps > Feed that material into a Reasoning Model > Generate Optimal Test Questions (see below)

## The Best Types of Self-Test for Learning

* Typically open-ended, short/long answer, minimal prompt tests...
* Typically not MC exams (which focus on familiarity or recognition), BUT inclusion "trip" questions that makes you focus on mastery of the material.

## TOOL ⚙️ - Gap Effects; Testing as Studying vs. Evaluation

* Periodically pausing the material that you're learning or take a quick break to allow your hippocampus to encode the information that is being provided to you.
* Taking a quick break where you walk down the hallway to review the material that you've just learned.

## TOOL ⚙️ - Using Emotion to Cue Learning

* Finding a way to and increase your emotional state to enhance the learning process.
    * Self-talk, testing yourself mentally, cold-exposure, caffine

## TOOL ⚙️ - Interweaving Information with "Unrelated" Examples

* Essentially, finding ways to introduce additional seemingly unrelated information into technical information that your learning as a way to retain material.
    * Biology Phylogenetic Tree & OOP Inheritance (e.g., Parent and Child Classes).

## Learning Stages

* JQR Example:
    * Basic: ability to be lead by a Senior and complete the tasks.
    * Senior: ability to act by oneself and teach Basic level individuals.
    * Master: domain expertise and the ability to teach/instruct Seniors.

* Academia Example:
    * Unskilled: unfamiliarity and limited understanding of a subject
    * Skilled: ability to know and recognize and use information in basic and sometimes advanced ways. 
    * Mastery: complete grasp of a subject and the ability to retain and use it flexibly across domains.
    * Virtuosity: mastery and depth of the material such that you can inject randomness and connect seemingly unrelated domains to the material that you've learned.
