# Elastic Agent Deployment and Windows Event Monitoring ðŸª‚

## **WireShark Filter for DeAuth Frames**

- **Set WiFi Adapter to Monitor Mode**
  - Select the interface that is placed into monitor mode (e.g., `wlan0mon`).
  
- **Filter for DeAuth Subtype**
  - Use the following filter in Wireshark:
  
  ```bash
  wlan.fc.type == 0 && wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0C
  ```

- **Additional Reference**
  - For more details, see the article on analyzing deauthentication packets in Wireshark.

## **Elastic Agent Deployment**

**Note:** Ensure the `elastic_agent_endpoint` option within Elastic allows the subnet of the boxes where you want to deploy agents (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

### **Creating New Agent Policy & Enrolling Agent**

- **Documentation:** Refer to the [Elastic Fleet Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html).

1. **Navigate to Security Onion Manager:**
   - Go to `Fleet > Add Agent`.

2. **Create New Agent Policy:**
   - Provide a descriptive name for the agent policy.

3. **Enroll in Fleet:**
   - Select the specific OS to install Elastic Agent (e.g., Windows or Linux).

4. **Install Elastic Agent:**
   - Remotely access the box where you want to install the agent and execute the following commands line by line:

   ```powershell
   $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.1.2:8443/artifacts/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.14.3-windows-x86_64.zip -OutFile elastic-agent-8.14.3-windows-x86_64.zip
   Expand-Archive .\elastic-agent-8.14.3-windows-x86_64.zip -DestinationPath .
   cd elastic-agent-8.14.3-windows-x86_64
   .\elastic-agent.exe install --url=https://192.168.1.2:8220 --enrollment-token=NlR2XzVKRUJGTVFRRVA4REF1d3c6STc5LVowcXVSQ3l6bjRuei1XOVpSQQ== --insecure
   ```

   **Note:** The `--insecure` flag is used to address x509 certificate signed by unknown authority errors (use only in development environments). For more information, see [Secure Connections](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.15/secure-connections.html)

5. **Validate Log Ingestion:**
   - Run a simple file creation script and identify this activity in Elastic:

   ```powershell
   for ($i=0; $i -lt 25; $i++) {
       New-Item -Path C:\Users\simspace\Host_Generation -Name "File$i.txt" -ItemType "file"
   }
   ```

## **Disenrolling Agents**

If Elastic Agent unenrollment fails, you can use the Kibana Fleet APIs to force unenroll the agent. Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.14/fleet-troubleshooting.html#deleted-policy-unenroll) for more information.

### **Using Kibana Fleet APIs**

1. **Access Management:**
   - Navigate to `Management > Dev`.

2. **Make API Request to Disenroll Agent:**

   ```bash
   POST kbn:/api/fleet/agents/<agent_id>/unenroll
   {
     "force": true,
     "revoke": true
   }
   ```

### **Manually Unenrolling Agent from Windows Box**

1. Stop the Elastic Agent service:

   ```powershell
   Stop-Service -Name "Elastic Agent"
   ```

2. Remove the Elastic Agent directory:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path "C:\Users\simspace\elastic-agent-8.14.3-windows-x86_64" -Recurse -Force
   ```

3. Delete the Elastic Agent service:

   ```powershell
   sc.exe delete "Elastic Agent"
   ```

4. Verify the service removal:

   ```powershell
   Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Elastic Agent*"}
   ```

### **Automatically Uninstalling Agent from Windows Box**

Navigate to the Elastic Agent directory and run the uninstall command:

```powershell
cd "C:\Path\to\elastic-agent-8.14.3-windows-x86_64"
.\elastic-agent.exe uninstall
```

## **Deploying Default/Custom Integrations**

### **Default Windows Integration**

The default "Windows Integration" in **Fleet > Agent Policies** contains essential Windows logging. To enhance it, include additional Event Codes to monitor.

- **Filter for Default Windows Integration:**

  ```bash
  winlog.channel: *
  ```

### **Add Custom Windows Event Logs Integration Using Elastic Fleet UI**

1. **Log into Elastic Cloud / Kibana:**
   - Open your web browser and log in to your Elastic Cloud or Kibana instance.
   - Navigate to the Fleet section in the side menu.

2. **Create or Update a Fleet Policy:**
   - Go to the Policies tab under Fleet.
   - Create a new policy or select an existing policy where the Windows agent is enrolled.

3. **Add Windows Integration to the Policy:**
   - Click "Add Integration" within the policy.
   - Search for Windows and install the integration.
   - Configure input fields for Application, Security, System logs, etc.

4. **Edit Integration Policy for Custom Event Logs:**
   - Click "Edit Integration."
   - Scroll to the Custom Event Logs section.
   - Add each log channel with its respective dataset and event IDs as defined in the YAML file below.

   **Note:** Check the "advanced" sections for additional configurations.

   **Example:**

   - Event Log Name: Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
   - Dataset Name: windows.custom.powerShell
   - Event IDs: 4103, 4104...

### **Add Custom Windows Event Logs Integration (Using YAML File Upload)**

**Note:** The YAML method offers flexibility and efficiency for deploying multiple custom Windows Event Logs.

1. **Ensure YAML Configuration is Correct:**

   ```yaml
   inputs:
     - type: winlog
       streams:
         - name: security
           dataset: windows.security
           event_logs:
             - name: Security
               event_id: 4624, 4625
         - name: application
           dataset: windows.application
           event_logs:
             - name: Application
               event_id: 1000, 1001
         - name: powershell
           dataset: windows.custom.powerShell
           event_logs:
             - name: Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
               event_id: 4103, 4104
         - name: terminal_services_remote_connection_manager
           dataset: windows.custom.terminalServices
           event_logs:
             - name: Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager/Operational
               event_id: 1149
         - name: terminal_services_local_session_manager
           dataset: windows.custom.localSessionManager
           event_logs:
             - name: Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational
               event_id: 21, 24, 25
   ```

2. **Apply YAML Configuration Manually (Optional):**
   - Modify the Elastic Agent's configuration file directly on the agent host:
     - For Linux: `/etc/elastic-agent/elastic-agent.yml`
     - For Windows: `C:\Program Files\Elastic\Agent\elastic-agent.yml`
   - Insert your YAML configuration under the "inputs" section.

3. **Restart the Agent:** Ensure to restart the agent after applying changes for them to take effect.

## **Review, Apply, and Verify Elastic Agents**

Once the agent has ingested the custom event logs, you can verify the logs in Kibana.

### **1. Verify Data Ingestion in Discover**

- **Select Index Pattern:**
  - In the index pattern dropdown, select `logs-*`, `logs-windows-*`, or the specific log ingestion setup you have.

- **Search for Custom Dataset and Event IDs:**
  - Use the following search query:

    ```bash
    event.dataset: "NAME_OF_DATASET" (e.g., "windows.custom.powershell") and event.code: (#### OR ####)
    ```

**Note:** Best practices for tracking integrations include:

- Using a common namespace (e.g., `vg24range`)
- Applying a common filter query (e.g., `winlog.channel: Microsoft-Windows*` and `winlog.channel: "Application"`)

### **2. Create Dashboard to Verify Creation of Agents**

- **Navigate to Dashboard:**
  - Go to **Kibana â†’ Dashboard**.

- **Create New Dashboard (if needed):**
  - Click on "Create new dashboard" to start from scratch or open an existing one to add visualizations.

- **Add a Visualization for PowerShell Logs:**
  - Click on "Create New" â†’ "Visualization."
  - Choose the type of visualization (e.g., table, bar chart, time series).

- **Set Up the Visualization:**
  - **Index Pattern:** Choose the appropriate index pattern, likely `logs-*` or `logs-windows-*`.
  - **Filter by Dataset:** Add a filter for the dataset you are interested in.
