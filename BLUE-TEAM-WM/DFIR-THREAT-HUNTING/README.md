# An Incident Response Mental Model 🪨 + ⚒️ = 🗿

- I interpret the incident response process as akin to the art of masonry. A **network analyst** scans the network landscape for anomalies, unusual traffic patterns, unauthorized connections, or other signs of compromise. Like a surveyor identifying quality stone deposits, the **network analyst** uncovers leads worth closer examination.  

- The process transitions to the **host analyst** or **incident responder**, assuming the role of the sculptor. Starting with a rough evidence, they refine their understanding through successive stages, employing increasingly precise tools and techniques.  

- As the “block” is progressively carved away, the **picture of the compromise** becomes clearer. Each step builds greater certainty about the attacker’s actions, culminating in a detailed “masterpiece” that maps the incident, its artifacts, and its impact.
