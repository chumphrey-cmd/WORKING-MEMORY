# Purpose

> To provide a workspace for programming concepts, fundamentals, and general reflection on what I learn each day. I also believe that it will be an indespensible source of notes and other information that I can reference during my learning journey.

## Table of Contents (so far...)

`boot_dev.md`
* A mono-markdown file of all boot.dev topics for the "backend developer" path segmented by topic. Eventually, I'll have to break apart each of the topics if file size becomes an issue (but that's a problem for future me).

`reflection.md`
* I'm hoping to use this space as a way to synthesize all of the information that I'm learning from building/breaking. Hopefully, I can distill the most essential lessons, patterns, and concepts that I come across.
