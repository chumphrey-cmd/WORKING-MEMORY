# Table of Contents (so far...)

- [`agile.md`](./CONCEPTS/agile_concepts.md)
  - Serves a central repository for agile methodologies and best practice for software development, the content here will evolve to also include Lean Six Sigma ideas for business creation.

- [`boot_dev.md`](./LESSONS/boot_dev.md)
  - A mono-markdown file of all boot.dev topics for the "backend developer" path segmented by topics. 
  - Eventually, I will have to break apart each of the topics when file size becomes too cumbersome (but that's a problem for future me).

- [`databases.md`](./LESSONS/databases.md)
  - Include database basics and best practice for scalability and efficiency. As I encounter more database specifics and nuances, I will include that information here for easy reference. 

- [`java.md`](./LESSONS/java.md)
  - Includes Java basics and best practices. Eventually, the examples and solutions to problem sets that I come across will become large enough for me to create a dedicated folder/repo for this language.

- [`reflection.md`](./LESSONS/reflection.md)
  - Space to synthesize all the information that I am learning from building/breaking. Hopefully, I can distill the most essential lessons, patterns, and concepts that I come across.
